 This is an example of how to use cookies to persist a session, 
 and also uses the principles of dynamic page generation 
 and URL encoded parameters.
 The example is formatted as a game. You first enter a username 
 and then begin to play. The game sets your username as a cookie,
 and when you close your browser or hit logout, your cookie is 
 deleted, and you will need to log in again.
 NOTE: The session begins at ./static/cookiesExample/index.html
